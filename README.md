Amazon QLDB supports the PartiQL query language. PartiQL provides SQL-compatible query access across multiple data stores containing structured data, semistructured data, and nested data.


A journal is the chained set of all blocks committed in your ledger. A block is an object that is committed to the journal in a transaction. The journal represents a complete and immutable history of all the changes to your ledger data.

With Amazon QLDB, you pay only for what you use with no minimum fees or mandatory service usage. You are billed separately for write IO requests, read IO requests, journal storage, indexed storage, and data transfer
